## Adding new drop down fields

What you’ll do later when you add new dropdown columns

When you add something like "grade" to inventory:

Add column uom in inventory database table (or start with a UI-only field, created in the admin Field Generator page)

Populate lookup_values table with field_key = grade

Use populateLookupSelect("grade", "grade", currentValue) on any form page inside the <script> </script>

And Field Management will automatically show uom in the dropdown.

Note that the field id must match your script - in the example -> id=grade
